Welcome to Secret Messanger!

Here is how it works: 
	You give the program a file with a message (encrypted or unencrypted).
	You give the program an additional file that contains the key.
	You indicate whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message using 'd' for decrypt and 'e' for encrypt.
	The program is called smess.
	
Rules for use:
	Your key MUST be on one line.
	Your message CAN include spaces.
	
Examples:
	./smess [message file] [key file] [destination file] [d/e]
	// the above is the prototype for running the program.

	./smess message.txt key.txt message.txt e
	// the above calls the program and encrypts the message in message.txt using the key in key.txt and places the result in message.txt.
	
	./smess message.txt key.txt out.txt d
	//the above calls the program and decrypts the message in message.txt using the key in key.txt and places the result in out.txt.
